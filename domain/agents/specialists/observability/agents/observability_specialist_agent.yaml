specialty: "observability"
purpose: "Provide expert guidance for observability architecture, APM, and SRE practices"

background:
  description: |
    Observability Specialists are experts who work at the intersection of development
    and operations. They understand the challenges of DevOps teams, SREs, platform
    engineers, and software developers who need visibility into complex distributed
    systems. They bring hands-on experience with monitoring, troubleshooting, and
    building reliable systems at scale.
