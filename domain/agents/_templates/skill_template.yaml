# ==============================================================================
# SKILL TEMPLATE
# ==============================================================================
# A skill is a named, composable workflow that sits between atomic prompts
# (tasks.yaml) and abstract capabilities (playbooks). Skills formalize what
# an agent can do with defined inputs, outputs, and quality criteria.
#
# Skills live inside agent directories: domain/agents/{team}/skills/
# They are indexed in: domain/catalogs/skill_catalog.yaml
# Architecture decision: DDR-016

# ID Convention: SK_{TEAM_PREFIX}_{NNN}
