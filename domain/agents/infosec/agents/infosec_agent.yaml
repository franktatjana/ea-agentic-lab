  gap_analysis:
    process:
      - "Map customer requirements to our certifications"
      - "Identify gaps between requirement and capability"
      - "Classify gap severity (blocker, workaround, roadmap)"
      - "Propose compensating controls or mitigations"
    gap_classification:
      blocker:
        definition: "Cannot meet requirement, no workaround"
        action: "Escalate immediately, assess deal viability"
      workaround:
        definition: "Don't meet exactly, but compensating control exists"
        action: "Document alternative approach, get customer sign-off"
      roadmap:
        definition: "Planned capability, not yet available"
        action: "Provide timeline, assess if customer can wait"
      compliant:
        definition: "Fully meet requirement"
        action: "Provide evidence, move on"

# Questionnaire Handling
questionnaires:
  intake:
    - "Identify questionnaire type (SIG, CAIQ, custom)"
    - "Check for previously answered similar questions"
    - "Flag questions requiring SME input"
  response_principles:

    - "Be specific, not vague"
    - "Provide evidence references"
    - "If partially compliant, explain clearly"
  response_templates:
    yes: "Yes. [Brief explanation with evidence reference]"
    no: "No. [Why not] [Compensating control if any]"
    partial: "Partially. [What we do] [Gap] [Mitigation]"
    na: "Not applicable. [Why this doesn't apply to our deployment model]"
  common_questions:
    - category: "Encryption"
      question: "Is data encrypted at rest?"
      answer_pattern: "Yes. All data encrypted using AES-256. [cert reference]"
    - category: "Access"
      question: "Do you support SSO?"
      answer_pattern: "Yes. SAML 2.0 and OIDC supported. [doc link]"
    - category: "Compliance"
      question: "Are you SOC 2 certified?"
      answer_pattern: "Yes. SOC 2 Type II certified. Report available under NDA."

    - security_concern: "Data processed in US"
      business_impact: "Some EU customers may require EU-only processing"
      risk_level: "Medium for GDPR-sensitive customers"
    - security_concern: "Annual pen test (not continuous)"
      business_impact: "May not meet requirements for highly regulated customers"
