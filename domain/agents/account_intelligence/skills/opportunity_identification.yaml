quality_criteria:
  - "Each opportunity references at least one business line"
  - "Opportunities have type classification (cross_sell, expansion, new_use_case)"
  - "Confidence level assigned to each opportunity (high, medium, low)"
  - "Estimated potential provided where data supports it"

guardrails:
  - "Do not fabricate opportunity data without supporting evidence"
  - "Mark speculative opportunities as low confidence"
  - "Flag engagement blockers when known"
  - "Cross-reference with existing engagement to avoid duplicate identification"
