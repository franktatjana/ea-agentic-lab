workflow:
  - step: 1
    action: "Prepare for discovery: research company, hypothesize use cases, prepare questions by dimension"
    prompt_ref: "prompts/tasks.yaml#technical_discovery.discovery_preparation"
    inputs: ["account_context", "known_context"]
    outputs: ["discovery_prep"]

  - step: 2
    action: "Discover business outcomes: extract business problems, success metrics, cost of inaction"
    prompt_ref: "prompts/tasks.yaml#technical_discovery.business_outcomes_discovery"
    inputs: ["customer_statements"]
    outputs: ["business_outcomes"]

  - step: 3
    action: "Map current state: technology inventory, architecture, pain points, gap analysis"
    prompt_ref: "prompts/tasks.yaml#technical_discovery.current_state_discovery"
    inputs: ["environment_info"]
    outputs: ["current_state"]

  - step: 4
    action: "Capture and prioritize requirements: must-haves, scale, compliance, integrations"
    prompt_ref: "prompts/tasks.yaml#technical_discovery.requirements_discovery"
    inputs: ["requirements_discussed"]
    outputs: ["requirements_matrix"]

  - step: 5
    action: "Synthesize findings into actionable summary with recommended solution approach"
    prompt_ref: "prompts/tasks.yaml#technical_discovery.discovery_synthesis"
    inputs: ["business_outcomes", "current_state", "requirements_matrix"]
    outputs: ["discovery_summary"]

    description: "Synthesized discovery: executive summary, business outcomes, current state, requirements, stakeholders, timeline, recommended approach, next steps"

  - name: "discovery_prep"
    type: "object"
    format: "yaml"
    description: "Pre-meeting preparation: research summary, questions by dimension, use case hypotheses"

quality_criteria:
  - "Business outcomes are specific and measurable"
  - "Current state includes technology inventory"
  - "Requirements are prioritized (Must/Should/Could)"
  - "Discovery summary includes recommended next steps"
  - "Red flags documented if identified"

guardrails:
  - "Ask questions, do not assume technical state"
  - "Validate customer statements against known data"
  - "Flag when specialist engagement is needed"
  - "Do not commit to solutions during discovery"
