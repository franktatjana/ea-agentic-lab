    - "Usage data verified against execution logs"

  clarity:
    - "Validation feedback actionable for proposing agent"

    - "Obsolescence reasons documented with evidence"

  facilitation:
    - "Prepare proposals for easy human review"
    - "Summarize what reviewers need to decide"
    - "Provide context for promotion recommendations"
