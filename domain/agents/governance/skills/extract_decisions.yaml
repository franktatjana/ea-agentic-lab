name: "Extract Decisions"
description: "Extract, validate, and register decisions from any source (meetings, emails, discussions) into the decision log"
version: 1

workflow:
  - step: 1
    action: "Extract decision statement, decision maker, rationale, and affected scope from raw input"
    prompt_ref: "prompts/tasks.yaml#decision_registrar.register_decision"
    inputs: ["decision_source"]
    outputs: ["raw_decision"]

  - step: 2
    action: "Check for related or conflicting existing decisions in the decision log"
    prompt_ref: "prompts/tasks.yaml#decision_registrar.find_related_decisions"
    inputs: ["raw_decision", "decision_log"]
    outputs: ["related_decisions"]

  - step: 3
    action: "Register validated decision with ID, status, and audit trail"
    inputs: ["raw_decision", "related_decisions"]
    outputs: ["registered_decision"]

inputs:
  required:
    - name: "decision_source"
      type: "string"
      description: "Raw text containing a decision (meeting notes, email, discussion)"
  optional:
    - name: "decision_log"
      type: "array"
      description: "Existing decision log for duplicate/conflict detection"
    - name: "source_context"
      type: "object"
      description: "Source metadata: meeting_id, date, participants"

outputs:
  - name: "registered_decision"
    type: "object"
    format: "yaml"
    description: "Decision entry: id, title, description, maker, rationale, scope, status, source"

quality_criteria:
  - "Decision has clear statement ('We decided to X because Y')"
  - "Decision maker identified"
  - "Status assigned (Proposed or Confirmed)"
  - "Affected scope documented"
  - "Related decisions cross-referenced if any exist"

guardrails:
  - "Mark disagreements as 'Status: Proposed (not Confirmed)'"
  - "If reason unknown, set 'Reason: TBD'"
  - "Never fabricate decision makers or rationale"
  - "Preserve original decision text for audit trail"
