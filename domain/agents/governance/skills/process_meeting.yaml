quality_criteria:
  - "All actions have single owner (not team or TBD)"
  - "All actions have due date or explicit TBD with reason"
  - "Decisions have owner and status (Proposed or Confirmed)"
  - "No orphan risks (must have severity)"
  - "Full notes max 12 lines"
  - "Slack digest produced (5 lines, always)"

guardrails:
  - "Never produce wordy notes, avoid paragraphs"
  - "Do not invent owners, dates, or decisions"
  - "Mark missing information as TBD instead of guessing"
  - "Prioritize decisions > actions > risks when input is messy"
