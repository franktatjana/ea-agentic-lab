# Framework operationalization for AI agents

# ==============================================================================
# PLAYBOOK METADATA
# ==============================================================================
framework_name: "Adoption Guidance"
framework_source: "Customer Success / Technology Adoption Best Practices"
intended_agent_role: "CA Agent (Customer Architect)"
secondary_agents: ["SA Agent provides architecture context for adoption milestones", "AE Agent uses adoption data for expansion opportunities"]
playbook_mode: "GENERATIVE"
playbook_category: "relationship_governance"

primary_objective: "Guide the customer through a structured adoption journey, from initial deployment through full operational maturity, with measurable milestones, success criteria, and intervention points"

vault_routing:
  primary_vault: "Customer InfoHub"
  rationale: "The adoption plan is a customer-facing roadmap showing where they are, where they're going, and what actions they need to take. It demonstrates value realization and builds confidence in the partnership."
  secondary_outputs:
    - vault: "Internal Account Hub"
      artifact: "Candid adoption risk assessment and intervention strategy"
    - vault: "Global Knowledge Vault"
      artifact: "Anonymized adoption patterns, common blockers, and time-to-value benchmarks (after engagement closes)"

when_not_to_use:
  - "Customer in active churn process (need recovery plan, not adoption guidance)"
  - "POC phase only (POC has its own success criteria via PB_501)"
  - "Customer explicitly managing adoption internally without vendor involvement"
  - "Product not deployed (adoption requires a running system)"

# ==============================================================================
# TRIGGER CONDITIONS
# ==============================================================================
trigger_conditions:

    - "Quarterly business review preparation (adoption progress review)"

  manual:
    - "CA explicitly creates adoption plan: '/adoption plan {scope}'"
    - "Customer requests adoption roadmap or maturity assessment"
    - "AE requests adoption status for expansion planning"

  conditional:
    - "IF deployment_complete AND no_adoption_plan_exists THEN trigger"
    - "IF feature_adoption_rate < 30% AND days_since_deployment > 90 THEN trigger"
    - "IF health_score[product_usage] == RED THEN trigger"
    - "IF expansion_opportunity_identified AND current_adoption_incomplete THEN trigger"

# KEY QUESTIONS TO EXTRACT
# ==============================================================================

  current_state:
    - "What is the current adoption level (users, features, use cases)?"
    - "Which capabilities are actively used vs. dormant?"
    - "What blockers are preventing further adoption?"
    - "How does current usage compare to what was planned at deployment?"

  target_state:
    - "What does full adoption look like for this customer?"
    - "Which use cases deliver the most business value?"
    - "What capabilities are available but not yet adopted?"
    - "What is the customer's timeline expectation for full adoption?"

  organizational:
    - "Who are the adoption champions within the customer organization?"
    - "Are there resistant teams or stakeholders? Why?"
    - "What organizational changes (reorgs, budget cycles) affect adoption?"
    - "Is there executive sponsorship for the adoption journey?"

  value_realization:
    - "Can the customer measure the value they've received so far?"
    - "What quick wins can demonstrate value to hesitant stakeholders?"
    - "How does adoption progress map to business outcomes?"
