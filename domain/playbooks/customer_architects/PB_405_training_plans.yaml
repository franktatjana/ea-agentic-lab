# PLAYBOOK: Tutorials and Training Plans
# Framework operationalization for AI agents

# ==============================================================================
# PLAYBOOK METADATA
# ==============================================================================
framework_name: "Tutorials and Training Plans"
framework_source: "Customer Success / Technical Enablement Best Practices"
intended_agent_role: "CA Agent (Customer Architect)"
secondary_agents: ["SA Agent provides architecture context for technical training", "Specialist provides domain-specific training content"]

primary_objective: "Design and deliver structured learning paths and tutorials that enable customer teams to build competency with the deployed solution, from basic operations to advanced use cases"

vault_routing:
  primary_vault: "Customer InfoHub"
  rationale: "Training plans and tutorials are professional services assets delivered to the customer. They accelerate time-to-value and reduce support dependency. The customer keeps these for ongoing team enablement."
  secondary_outputs:
    - vault: "Global Knowledge Vault"
      artifact: "Anonymized training templates and common learning paths (after engagement closes)"

when_not_to_use:
  - "Customer has vendor-certified training program already in place"
  - "Solution not yet deployed (training requires hands-on practice)"
  - "Customer explicitly declines training (document the decision)"
  - "Scope limited to a POC with no production intent"

# ==============================================================================
# TRIGGER CONDITIONS
# ==============================================================================
trigger_conditions:
  automatic:
    - "Solution deployed and customer onboarding phase starts"
    - "New customer team members joining (headcount change detected)"
    - "Major feature update or solution upgrade deployed"
    - "Customer health score declining due to low feature adoption"
    - "Post-POC transition to production (team needs production-level skills)"

  manual:
    - "CA explicitly creates training plan: '/training plan {audience}'"
    - "Customer requests training session or enablement workshop"
    - "SA hands off to CA with training needs noted"

  conditional:
    - "IF feature_adoption_rate < 40% AND solution_deployed > 60_days THEN trigger"
    - "IF new_team_members >= 3 AND no_training_plan_exists THEN trigger"
    - "IF health_score[product_usage] == YELLOW THEN trigger"

# ==============================================================================
# REQUIRED INPUTS
# ==============================================================================
required_inputs:
  mandatory:
    - artifact: "Deployed solution description (from PB_104 or equivalent)"
    - artifact: "Target audience roles and current skill levels"
    - artifact: "Customer's available time for training (half-day, full-day, multi-session)"

  optional:
    - artifact: "Customer's existing knowledge and experience"
      use: "Skip content they already know"
    - artifact: "Support case history"

    - artifact: "Customer's learning preferences (hands-on, lecture, self-paced)"
      use: "Adapt delivery format"
    - artifact: "Vendor training catalog"
      use: "Link to formal courses and certifications"
    - artifact: "Customer's use cases prioritized by business value"
      use: "Sequence training around highest-impact use cases first"

  minimum_data_threshold:
    - "Target audience identified"
    - "Solution deployed and accessible for hands-on exercises"

# ==============================================================================
# KEY QUESTIONS TO EXTRACT
# ==============================================================================
key_questions:
  audience:
    - "Who needs training (roles: admin, analyst, developer, manager)?"
    - "What is their current skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?"
    - "How many people need training?"
    - "What is their available time for training?"

  objectives:
    - "What should participants be able to do after training?"
    - "Which use cases are highest priority for the customer?"
    - "What tasks do they need to perform daily vs. occasionally?"
    - "Are there compliance or certification requirements?"

  logistics:
    - "What is the preferred delivery format (live, recorded, self-paced, workshop)?"
    - "Does the customer have a lab or sandbox environment for practice?"
    - "What is the timeline for training completion?"
    - "Is there a train-the-trainer need (customer will train future hires)?"

  content:
    - "What existing vendor training materials are relevant?"
    - "Are there customer-specific configurations that need custom training content?"
    - "What common mistakes or pitfalls should training address proactively?"
