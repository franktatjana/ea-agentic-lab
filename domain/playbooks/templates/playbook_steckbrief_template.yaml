# Playbook Steckbrief Template
#
# Human-readable fact sheet for any playbook. Answers the mental questions
# a person has when they first encounter a playbook: What is it? Who runs it?
# When? What goes in? What comes out? What decisions does it drive?
#
# Auto-fill instructions: extract values from the source playbook YAML.
# Field mappings show where each value originates.
