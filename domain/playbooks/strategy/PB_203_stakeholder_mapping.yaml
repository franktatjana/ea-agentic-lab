# GAP DETECTION LOGIC
# ==============================================================================
gap_detection:
  # Critical: Decision-makers not identified
  - condition: "decision_makers_unknown"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    gap_type: "DECISION_AUTHORITY_UNKNOWN"
    warning: "Key decision-makers not identified - unclear who decides budget/technical/procurement"
    impact: "Deal may be blocked by unidentified stakeholders, wasted effort on wrong people"
    action: "Map organizational chart, identify decision authority for budget, technical, and procurement"
    escalate_to: "AE + Exec Sponsor"

  # Critical: No champion identified
  - condition: "no_champion_identified"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    gap_type: "MISSING_CHAMPION"
    warning: "No internal champion (HIGH power + HIGH interest) identified"
    impact: "No one advocating for {vendor} internally, deal vulnerable"
    action: "Identify and cultivate champion at VP+ level with budget authority and high engagement"
    escalate_to: "AE + Exec Sponsor"

  # High: Blocker not managed
  - condition: "blocker_not_managed"
    severity: "HIGH"
    gap_type: "UNMANAGED_BLOCKER"
    warning: "Blocker identified (HIGH power, negative sentiment) but no mitigation strategy"
    impact: "Deal can be vetoed, project can be stopped"
    action: "Develop strategy to address blocker concerns, engage exec sponsor to neutralize"
    escalate_to: "AE + Exec Sponsor"

  # High: Key stakeholder power/interest not assessed
  - condition: "stakeholders_not_classified"
    severity: "HIGH"
    gap_type: "INCOMPLETE_MAPPING"
    warning: "Stakeholders identified but not classified by power and interest"
    impact: "Engagement strategy generic, high-value relationships under-invested, low-value over-invested"
    action: "Assess power (decision authority) and interest (engagement) for each stakeholder, classify into grid"
    escalate_to: "AE"

  # Medium: Engagement strategy not tailored
  - condition: "engagement_not_tailored"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    gap_type: "GENERIC_ENGAGEMENT"
    warning: "Stakeholder engagement is one-size-fits-all, not tailored to power/interest quadrant"
    impact: "Wasted effort on low-priority stakeholders, insufficient attention to key influencers"
    action: "Define engagement strategy per quadrant: Manage Closely (high power + high interest), Keep Satisfied (high power + low interest), etc."
    escalate_to: "AE"

  # High: Champion at risk
  - condition: "champion_at_risk"
    severity: "HIGH"
    gap_type: "CHAMPION_CHURN"
    warning: "Champion relationship degrading (decreased engagement, departure risk, sentiment decline)"
    impact: "Loss of internal advocate, deal momentum loss"
    action: "Re-engage champion, address concerns, activate exec sponsor for reinforcement"
    escalate_to: "AE + Exec Sponsor"

  # Medium: Stakeholder changes not tracked
  - condition: "stakeholder_churn_not_tracked"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    gap_type: "OUTDATED_MAPPING"
    warning: "Stakeholder map not updated for organizational changes (departures, promotions, reorg)"
    impact: "Engaging wrong people, missing new decision-makers"
    action: "Update stakeholder map, identify new decision-makers, re-engage"
    escalate_to: "AE"

  # Low: LinkedIn profile missing
  - condition: "linkedin_profile_missing"
    severity: "LOW"
    gap_type: "MISSING_LINKEDIN_PROFILE"
    warning: "Stakeholder LinkedIn profile URL not documented"
    impact: "Cannot verify role, background, or connections for engagement planning"
    action: "Look up stakeholder on LinkedIn and add profile URL to stakeholder record"
    escalate_to: "AE"

  # Low: End users not engaged
