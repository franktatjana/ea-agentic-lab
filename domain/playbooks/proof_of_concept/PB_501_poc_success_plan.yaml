# PLAYBOOK: POC Success Plan
# Framework operationalization for AI agents

# ==============================================================================
# PLAYBOOK METADATA
# ==============================================================================
framework_name: "POC Success Plan"
framework_source: "Industry Enterprise POV/POC Best Practices"
intended_agent_role: "POC Agent (primary), SA Agent (technical support)"
secondary_agents: ["AE Agent provides commercial context", "VE Agent provides value criteria", "Nudger Agent tracks milestones"]
playbook_mode: "GENERATIVE"
playbook_category: "content_generation"

primary_objective: "Maximize POC-to-win conversion through structured success plans with customer commitments, clear success criteria, and decision timelines"

philosophy: |
  "A POC is a buying process, not a science experiment."
  Core principles:
  1. No POC without commitment - Customer must have skin in the game
  2. Shorter is better - 2-4 weeks, not 3 months
  3. Prove value, not features - Tied to business outcomes
  4. Agreed criteria before starting - No moving goalposts
  5. Decision timeline locked - Know when you'll get an answer

when_not_to_use:
  - "Customer not qualified (no budget, no authority, no timeline)"
  - "Technical fit not validated in discovery"
  - "Customer unwilling to commit resources or decision timeline"
  - "Scope undefined (>5 success criteria or 'we'll figure it out')"
