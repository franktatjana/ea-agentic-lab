# EA Agentic Lab

> Multi-agent governance platform for enterprise account management

EA Agentic Lab is a system where 24 AI-assisted agents collaborate to manage complex enterprise engagements through playbook-driven execution, signal-based communication, and automated governance.

## Core Concepts

- **Realm**: A company/customer organization (e.g., ACME, BMW)
- **Node**: A specific engagement within a Realm (e.g., SECURITY_CONSOLIDATION)
- **Playbook**: Small, reusable unit of work with inputs, steps, outputs
- **Bundle**: Collection of playbooks grouped by phase (discovery, implementation)
- **Blueprint**: Global governance model (agents, signals, thresholds)
- **Canvas**: One-page visual artifact for humans (Markdown + HTML output)
- **Signal**: Event emitted by agents to trigger downstream actions
- **Checklist**: Machine-readable validation rules with assertions

## Architecture

24 agents organized in 3 tiers:
- Strategic (15): Domain experts (SA, AE, CSM, PM agents)
- Governance (8): Cross-cutting oversight (Risk, Compliance, Quality)
- Orchestration (1): Senior Manager Agent coordinates all

Communication via signals: Producer emits → Signal Bus → Consumers process

## Key Directories

- `/config/` - Global configuration (signals, thresholds, checklists, bundles)
- `/playbooks/` - Playbook definitions (executable, operational, canvas)
- `/teams/` - Agent definitions organized by team
- `/docs/` - Architecture and reference documentation
- `/examples/infohub/` - Sample realm/node data
- `/project/` - Project management (PRD, milestones, contributing guide)
- `/backend/api/` - FastAPI REST API

## Playbook Categories

- Strategic: Consulting frameworks (SWOT, PESTLE, Porter's 5 Forces)
- Operational: Event-driven procedures (meeting governance, escalation)
- Canvas: Visual artifact rendering (8 canvas types)
- Validation: Quality control (PB_970 validation, PB_971 gap scan)

## Data Flow

1. Trigger (scheduled, signal, manual) activates playbook
2. Pre-execution checklists validate inputs
3. Playbook steps execute with Decision Logic Language (DLL)
4. Outputs written to InfoHub with provenance
5. Post-execution checklists validate quality
6. Signals emitted to notify downstream agents

## Configuration Files

- `config/signal_catalog.yaml` - Signal definitions with producers/consumers
- `config/checklists/*.yaml` - Validation rules (playbook, blueprint, canvas)
- `config/bundles/*.yaml` - Playbook collections by phase
- `config/thresholds.yaml` - Business parameters (health alerts, staleness)

## Canvas Types

Core canvases: Context Canvas, Decision Canvas
Specialized: Value & Stakeholders, Architecture Communication, Execution Map, Risk & Governance, Problem-Solution Fit, Architecture Decision

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/nodes/{realm}/{node}` - Node profile
- `GET /api/v1/nodes/{realm}/{node}/health` - Health score
- `GET /api/v1/nodes/{realm}/{node}/risks` - Risk register
- `GET /api/v1/nodes/{realm}/{node}/actions` - Action tracker
- `GET /api/v1/signals` - Signal feed
