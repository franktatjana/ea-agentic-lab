# EA Agentic Lab

> Multi-agent governance platform for enterprise account management

EA Agentic Lab combines 28 AI-assisted agents with 91 playbooks to bring structure to enterprise pre-sales and post-sales engagements. Agents enforce governance, capture knowledge, and surface risks, while humans make decisions. The domain model is fully defined in declarative YAML; the runtime layer is not yet built.

## Core Concepts

- **Realm**: A customer organization (e.g., ACME_CORP, GLOBEX)
- **Node**: A specific engagement within a Realm (e.g., SECURITY_CONSOLIDATION)
- **Archetype**: Engagement pattern classified by signals (competitive displacement, greenfield, compliance, etc.)
- **Blueprint**: Playbook composition for a specific archetype, domain, and engagement track
- **Playbook**: Reusable unit of work with inputs, steps, outputs, and validation
- **Operational Playbook**: Event-driven micro-playbook for tactical procedures (meeting notes, risk registration, escalation)
- **Canvas**: One-page visual artifact rendered from structured data
- **Signal**: Event emitted by agents to trigger downstream actions
- **Checklist**: Machine-readable validation rules with assertions

## Agents (28 configured)

- Strategic (15): Domain experts (SA, AE, CA, VE, POC, CI, PM, Delivery, Partner, Specialist, PS, Support, RFP, InfoSec, Senior Manager)
- Governance (9): Process enforcement (Meeting Notes, Nudger, Task Shepherd, Decision Registrar, Reporter, Risk Radar, Playbook Curator, InfoHub Curator, Knowledge Vault Curator)
- Specialized (3): Retrospective, Tech Signal Scanner, Tech Signal Analyzer
- Specialist sub-teams (3): Security, Search, Observability

Communication via signals: Producer emits -> Signal Bus -> Consumers process

## Knowledge Architecture

Three-vault model separating knowledge by audience:
- **External InfoHub**: Per-account, shareable with customer (architecture docs, ADRs, POC plans)
- **Internal InfoHub**: Per-account, vendor-only (competitive intel, deal reviews, pricing)
- **Global Knowledge Vault**: Cross-account, anonymized best practices and tribal knowledge

## Directory Structure

- `domain/agents/{team}/` - 28 agent configs, personalities, and task prompts
- `domain/playbooks/{team}/` - 91 playbook YAMLs organized by team
- `domain/playbooks/operational/` - 6 event-driven micro-playbooks
- `domain/playbooks/canvas/` - 8 canvas specifications and registry
- `domain/playbooks/templates/` - 8 reusable playbook templates
- `domain/catalogs/` - Agent catalog, signal catalog, archetypes, tech signal map
- `domain/config/` - Checklists, thresholds, connectors
- `domain/mappings/` - Agent role mapping, engagement tracks
- `domain/blueprints/` - Reference blueprints and schema
- `docs/architecture/` - System design (agents, playbooks, core entities)
- `docs/operating-model/` - RACI model, engagement phases
- `docs/decisions/` - DDR and ADR records
- `docs/guides/` - Practitioner and developer guides
- `docs/reference/` - Catalogs, quick-reference, terminology
- `vault/` - Knowledge vaults organized by realm/node (raw inputs, customer InfoHub, internal hub, global knowledge base)
- `application/` - Streamlit UI + Swift iOS app (scaffolded)

## Playbook Categories

- Strategic (59): Consulting frameworks (SWOT, PESTLE, Five Forces, TOGAF, MEDDPICC, Value Engineering)
- Specialist (32): Domain-specific evaluation (Security 12, Search 10, Observability 10)
- Operational (6): Event-driven procedures (meeting notes, risk registration, escalation, health alerts)
- Canvas/Admin (8): Visual artifact rendering and validation
- Templates (8): Reusable playbook templates

## Engagement Classification

Three orthogonal dimensions:
1. **Archetype**: What kind (competitive displacement, greenfield, consolidation, compliance, evaluation, renewal, expansion, strategic)
2. **Domain**: Which specialty (security, search, observability, multi-domain)
3. **Track**: Service tier (POC, economy, premium, fast track)

Archetype x Domain -> Reference Blueprint -> + Track -> Blueprint Instance -> Playbooks

## Data Flow

1. Trigger (event, signal, threshold, scheduled, manual) activates playbook
2. Pre-execution checklists validate inputs
3. Playbook steps execute with Decision Logic Language (DLL)
4. Outputs written to InfoHub with provenance
5. Post-execution checklists validate quality
6. Signals emitted to notify downstream agents

## Current Status

Domain layer complete: 91 playbooks, 28 agents, 8 canvas specs, operating model with RACI. Runtime layer not yet built: no execution engine, no agent runtime, no API endpoints. See `docs/planning/implementation-status.md` for details.
