executive_summary: |
  Extremely favorable deal conditions. Algolia price increase widens our
  TCO advantage. Initech's AI HR Assistant creates a strategic dependency
  on vector/semantic search where we clearly differentiate. Market data
  confirms enterprise search and RAG are converging, positioning our
  platform as the infrastructure for Initech's AI ambitions.

# COMPETITIVE MOVES

competitive_moves:
  - competitor: "Algolia"
    date: "2026-01-18"
    news: "Algolia announces 30% price increase for growth-tier customers, effective Q2 2026"
    source: "Industry pricing intelligence"
    confidence: "reported"
    our_response: |
      Major competitive gift. Initech's projected Algolia cost jumps from
      $170K to $220K+ annually. Our pricing at $120K represents a $100K+
      annual savings. Update TCO comparison and ensure Peter Gibbons has
      the numbers before Algolia's formal communication reaches Initech.
    urgency: "THIS_WEEK"

  - competitor: "Algolia"
    date: "2026-02-03"
    news: "Algolia launches 'Algolia NeuralSearch' with vector search capabilities"
    source: "Algolia blog"
    confidence: "confirmed"
    our_response: |
      Algolia closing the vector search gap, but implementation is limited:
      max 100 dimensions, no custom embeddings, no hybrid scoring control.
      Our platform offers 1536+ dimensions, custom embeddings, and full
      hybrid scoring. Prepare technical comparison for POC evaluation.
    urgency: "THIS_WEEK"

  - competitor: "OpenSearch (build-your-own)"
    date: "2026-02-07"
    news: "OpenSearch 3.0 released with improved vector search and ML inference"
    source: "OpenSearch blog"
    confidence: "confirmed"
    our_response: |
      Build option becomes slightly more viable with OpenSearch 3.0, but
      operational burden remains. Initech prefers buy over build per
      discovery call. Counter with: time-to-value (4 hours vs weeks),
      managed infrastructure, and no DevOps burden.
    urgency: "MONITOR"

market_signals:
  - signal: "Enterprise search and RAG architectures converging"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    source: "Forrester"
    implication_for_deal: |
      Search platforms are becoming the retrieval layer for AI applications.
      Initech's AI HR Assistant is exactly this pattern. Position our platform
      as "search + AI retrieval" infrastructure, not just "search box."

  - signal: "HR SaaS platforms racing to add AI features"
    date: "2026-02-03"
    source: "Josh Bersin Research"
    detail: "60% of SaaS HR platforms planning AI features in 2026"
    implication_for_deal: |
      Initech faces competitive pressure to ship AI features. Search
      infrastructure is a time-critical dependency. Delay = competitive
      disadvantage in their market. Creates urgency for our deal.

  - signal: "Vector search becoming table stakes for enterprise search platforms"
    date: "2026-02-08"
    source: "DB-Engines trend report"
    detail: "Vector search queries in enterprise search grew 340% in 2025"
    implication_for_deal: |
      Validates Initech's requirement for semantic/vector search. Our
      native vector search with hybrid scoring is a decisive differentiator
      vs Algolia's limited NeuralSearch offering.

# TALKING POINTS
# ============================================================================
talking_points:
  - "Your AI HR Assistant needs a retrieval layer that handles vector search, semantic understanding, and traditional keyword search. We do all three natively."
  - "Algolia's price increase means $100K+ annual savings with us, and that gap widens as you grow. At your growth rate, the 3-year TCO difference is $300K+."
  - "Forrester says search platforms without vector search will lose relevance by 2027. Your IPO readiness requires future-proof infrastructure."
  - "60% of your competitors are adding AI features this year. The search infrastructure decision is time-critical for your competitive position."
