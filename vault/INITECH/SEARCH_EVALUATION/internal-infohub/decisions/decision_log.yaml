  # ============ POC & EVALUATION DECISIONS ============
  - decision_id: "INT_DEC_001"
    date: "2026-01-10"
    title: "POC Scope and Environment Agreed"
    description: "Agreed on POC scope: product catalog search with relevance tuning, faceted navigation, and analytics"
    context: "Initech evaluating replacement for Algolia after 40% price increase. Need focused POC to demonstrate value"
    source: "MTG_EXT_20260110"
    decision_maker: "Priya Sharma (Staff Engineer, Champion)"
    stakeholders:
      - "Dev Team Lead"
      - "VP Product (informed)"
    category: "technical"
    status: "implemented"
    rationale: |
      - Focus on highest-value use case (product search) for fastest time to value
      - Relevance tuning is our strongest differentiator vs Algolia
      - Product catalog data is readily available for POC
      - 2.1M documents is production-representative scale
    implications:
      - "POC sandbox provisioned with product catalog data"
      - "React SDK integration in Initech staging environment"
      - "4-week evaluation timeline agreed"
    linked_risks:
      - "EVAL_TIMELINE"

  - decision_id: "INT_DEC_002"
    date: "2026-01-20"
    title: "POC Success Criteria Defined"
    description: "Established measurable success criteria for POC evaluation"
    context: "Need objective metrics to compare our platform vs Algolia vs build option"
    source: "MTG_EXT_20260120"
    decision_maker: "Priya Sharma (Staff Engineer)"
    stakeholders:
      - "Dev Team Lead"
      - "VP Product"
    category: "technical"
    status: "implemented"
    rationale: "Objective criteria prevent evaluation from becoming subjective or political"
    implications:
      - "Relevance quality: >15% improvement over current Algolia baseline"
      - "Search latency: p99 < 200ms at 2M+ document scale"
      - "Integration effort: working prototype in < 2 developer-days"
      - "TCO: competitive with Algolia at current and 3-year projected volumes"
    success_criteria:
      relevance_improvement: ">15% over Algolia baseline (NDCG metric)"
      latency_p99: "<200ms"
      integration_effort: "<2 developer-days for basic implementation"
      tco_comparison: "Within 20% of Algolia at current scale"
    linked_risks:
      - "ALGOLIA_UX_PERCEPTION"

  - decision_id: "INT_DEC_003"
    date: "2026-01-28"
    title: "Pricing Approach: Value-Based, Not Price War"
    description: "Position on price: compete on total value and relevance quality, not lowest price"
    context: "Algolia still cheaper at entry point despite price increase. Our value is in ML relevance and enterprise features"
    source: "MTG_INT_20260128"
    decision_maker: "AE"
    stakeholders:
      - "Deal Desk"
      - "Sales Director"
    category: "commercial"
    status: "approved"
    rationale: |
      - Algolia at $120K/yr vs our $150K/yr, but we deliver superior relevance
      - Price matching would undervalue our ML capabilities
      - Initech cares about search quality impact on conversion, not just cost
      - Multi-year deal with growth pricing can narrow gap
    implications:
      - "$150K ARR list price, with multi-year discount to $135K"
      - "ROI story: 1% conversion improvement = $500K+ revenue for Initech"
      - "No further discounting without VP approval"
    linked_risks:
      - "ALGOLIA_UX_PERCEPTION"

  - decision_id: "INT_DEC_004"
    date: "2026-02-01"
    title: "Competitive Positioning: Relevance and Scale"
    description: "Lead competitive narrative with relevance quality and enterprise scale, not feature parity"
    context: "Algolia has developer mindshare. We need to shift conversation from 'easy API' to 'business impact'"
    source: "MTG_INT_20260201"
    decision_maker: "AE + CI Agent"
    stakeholders:
      - "SA"
      - "Product Marketing"
    category: "competitive"
    status: "approved"
    rationale: |
      - Algolia wins on 'easy to start', we win on 'better outcomes at scale'
      - Initech is pre-IPO, will need enterprise features Algolia lacks
      - Their 40% price increase signals Algolia moving upmarket (our territory)
      - Reference customer story of Algolia-to-us migration is powerful proof point
    implications:
      - "All demos lead with relevance quality comparison"
      - "TCO analysis includes Algolia's price trajectory"
      - "Reference call with similar migration customer"
      - "IPO readiness positioning in security/compliance materials"

      - "ALGOLIA_UX_PERCEPTION"
      - "IPO_REQUIREMENTS"
