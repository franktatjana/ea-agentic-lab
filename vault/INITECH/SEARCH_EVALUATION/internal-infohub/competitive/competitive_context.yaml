# COMPETITIVE SUMMARY
# ============================================================================
summary:
  threat_level: "high"
  primary_competitor: "Algolia"
  competitive_status: "Head-to-head evaluation"
  win_probability: "55%"
  key_battleground: "Ease-of-use vs. TCO + AI readiness"

  headline: |
    Algolia is the primary competitor with strong developer mindshare. Their
    upcoming 30% price increase for growth-tier customers creates a window of
    opportunity. Our vector search capability for the AI HR Assistant use case
    and superior TCO at scale are key differentiators. Must win POC on
    technical merit while addressing ease-of-use perception gap.
