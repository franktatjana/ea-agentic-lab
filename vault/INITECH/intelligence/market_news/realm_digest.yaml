executive_summary: |
  Highly favorable deal environment for Initech. Series C funding ($45M)
  secures budget for search investment. The AI HR Assistant announcement
  makes search infrastructure a strategic dependency, not a feature.
  Algolia's 30% price increase weakens the primary competitor's position.
  Deal urgency is high with IPO readiness on the horizon.

      AI HR Assistant uses RAG architecture, making search infrastructure a
      foundational dependency. This elevates our deal from "improve search UX"
      to "enable AI product strategy." Vector search and semantic capabilities
      become critical selection criteria, where we differentiate from Algolia.

      - role: "SA"
        action: "Prepare RAG architecture demo showing vector search + semantic retrieval for HR documents"
      - role: "AE"
        action: "Reframe deal value: search platform is AI enabler, not just UX improvement"

      Algolia's growth tier is exactly where Initech would land. At 2,000
      customers with 40% YoY growth, Initech's projected Algolia spend jumps
      from $170K to $220K+ annually. Our TCO advantage widens significantly.
