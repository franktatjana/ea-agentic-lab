# Deal Review: ACME Security Consolidation

## Opportunity Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Account | ACME Corporation |
| Opportunity | Security Platform Consolidation |
| Value | $800,000 ARR |
| Stage | Discovery |
| Close Date | Q4 2026 |
| Probability | 40% |
| Competition | CloudSIEM, LegacySIEM |

## MEDDPICC Assessment

### Metrics
- **Current state**: 4 security tools, $1.2M combined annual spend
- **Target state**: Single platform, 30% cost reduction target
- **Success metrics**: Consolidation of tools, reduced MTTD, simplified compliance

**Score: 7/10** - Clear metrics, but need to validate cost reduction assumptions

### Economic Buyer
- **Identified**: Marcus Weber (CTO)
- **Budget**: Approved by board
- **Access**: Indirect through Dr. Chen, need direct engagement

**Score: 6/10** - Budget confirmed, but no direct CTO conversation yet

### Decision Criteria
- Integration with existing platform stack (advantage)
- OT/ICS security capabilities (validate)
- EU data residency (can meet)
- 24/7 security support (need to confirm SLA)

**Score: 7/10** - Criteria favor us, some validation needed

### Decision Process
- Technical evaluation: Security team POC (Jan-Mar)
- Business case: Dr. Chen + Finance
- Final approval: CTO + CISO
- Procurement: Standard enterprise process

**Score: 6/10** - Process understood, timeline aggressive

### Paper Process
- Standard enterprise procurement
- Security review required
- Legal review 4-6 weeks
- No unusual requirements identified

**Score: 8/10** - Well understood

### Identified Pain
- Tool sprawl causing operational overhead
- Compliance audit findings on visibility gaps
- Board pressure to reduce vendor count
- Security team burnout from context switching

**Score: 9/10** - Strong, documented pain

### Champion
- **Primary**: Dr. Sarah Chen (Head of Engineering)
- **Strength**: Strong - Owns decision criteria, budget holder's trust
- **Risk**: Security team may have different champion candidate

**Score: 7/10** - Strong champion, but security team alignment needed

### Competition

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Strategy |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| CloudSIEM | Native Azure integration | No observability story | Unified platform narrative |
| LegacySIEM | Incumbent in SIEM | High cost, no integration | TCO + consolidation story |

**Score: 6/10** - Competitive, but we have differentiation

### Overall MEDDPICC Score: 56/80 (70%)

## Discussion Points

### 1. Deal Strategy
**James (Sales Director)**:
"This is a land-and-expand success story in the making. We need to protect the observability base while winning security. What's our timeline risk?"

**Alex (AE)**:
"Board wants year-end completion. That's aggressive for a security platform replacement. We need to manage expectations while showing momentum."

### 2. Technical Validation
**Nina (Security Specialist)**:
"OT/ICS is critical for manufacturing. We have the capabilities but need to prepare specific demos. I'll lead the technical session."

**Maria (SA)**:
"Integration with existing observability is our key differentiator. I'll prepare an architecture showing unified visibility."

### 3. Competitive Response
**James**:
"Microsoft will push the 'all Azure' narrative. What's our counter?"

**Alex**:
"Dr. Chen specifically mentioned they don't want vendor lock-in. Multi-cloud flexibility is our angle."

### 4. Risk Discussion
**Key Risks Identified**:
1. **Timeline**: Year-end deadline may not be achievable for full deployment
2. **Security team alignment**: They may prefer incumbent (LegacySIEM)
3. **Competition**: Microsoft has strong enterprise presence
4. **Technical**: OT/ICS requirements need validation

**Mitigations**:
1. Propose phased approach: POC → Pilot → Full deployment
2. Early engagement with security team, identify their champion
3. Reference customers and TCO analysis
4. Specialist-led technical validation

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Owner | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Pursue aggressively | James Park | Strategic account, strong fit |
| POC-first approach | Alex Thompson | Reduce timeline risk |
| Engage security specialist | Nina Kowalski | Critical technical validation |
| Request exec sponsor call | Alex Thompson | Need CTO direct engagement |

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Submit POC proposal | Alex Thompson | 2026-01-15 | P1 |
| Prepare OT/ICS demo environment | Nina Kowalski | 2026-01-19 | P1 |
| TCO comparison analysis | Maria Santos | 2026-01-17 | P1 |
| Request CTO meeting via Dr. Chen | Alex Thompson | 2026-01-13 | P1 |
| Competitive intelligence on Sentinel | CI Team | 2026-01-18 | P2 |
| Identify manufacturing security reference | Maria Santos | 2026-01-17 | P2 |

## Next Review
- Date: 2026-01-26
- Focus: POC proposal feedback, technical session outcomes
- Escalation: If CTO meeting not secured by Jan 20

## Framework Application
- **Recommended**: Apply Three Horizons analysis (current vs expansion revenue)
- **Recommended**: Value Engineering for TCO justification
- **Recommended**: SWOT for competitive positioning
