# Emergency Deal Review: ACME-Industrietechnik Security Consolidation

## Meeting Purpose

Emergency review following CTO strategic alignment meeting (Jan 15). Situation has fundamentally changed. VP-level attendance required for resource and strategy decisions.

## Situation Summary

| Dimension | Previous (Jan 12) | Current (Jan 16) | Change |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| Opportunity Value | $800K | $1.75M | +119% |
| Scope | 8 plants | 20 plants | +150% |
| Timeline | 12 months | 6 months | -50% |
| Decision Maker | Dr. Chen | Klaus Hoffman (CISO) | New stakeholder |
| Competition | Microsoft, LegacySIEM | **LegacySIEM only** | More focused |
| Budget | $800K approved | €3M allocated | Unconstrained |
| Risk Level | Medium | **Critical** | Elevated |

## Revised MEDDPICC Assessment

### Metrics - IMPROVED (8/10 → 9/10)
- Combined entity: 20 plants, 15,000 employees
- Security tool consolidation: 6 → 1
- Budget: €3M allocated (unconstrained)
- Board-mandated success metrics

### Economic Buyer - STABLE (6/10)
- Marcus Weber (CTO) confirmed as executive sponsor
- Direct access now established
- Budget authority confirmed
- **Risk**: Klaus Hoffman has strong influence

### Decision Criteria - CHANGED (7/10 → 6/10)
- OT/ICS at scale now mandatory (was nice-to-have)
- LegacySIEM migration path required
- 6-month deployment timeline
- **New**: Must satisfy CISO with LegacySIEM background

### Decision Process - CHANGED (6/10 → 5/10)
- Klaus Hoffman (CISO) now controls technical decision
- Board oversight added (quarterly reviews)
- Accelerated timeline reduces evaluation window
- **Risk**: Compressed decision cycle favors incumbent

### Paper Process - IMPROVED (8/10 → 9/10)
- Pre-approved budget
- Acquisition drives urgency
- Standard procurement, but expedited
- Legal/security review streamlined

### Identified Pain - STRONGER (9/10 → 10/10)
- Regulatory mandate: unified security in 6 months
- Tool sprawl doubled (now 6 tools)
- Integration complexity with acquisition
- Board-level visibility on execution

### Champion - AT RISK (7/10 → 5/10)
- Dr. Chen remains supportive but influence reduced
- Klaus Hoffman unknown/skeptical
- Need to build new champion or convert Klaus
- **Critical**: Champion gap is primary risk

### Competition - ELEVATED (6/10 → 4/10)
- LegacySIEM is incumbent at both companies
- Klaus has 5-year LegacySIEM relationship
- LegacySIEM offering contract consolidation deal
- Microsoft eliminated (not Azure shop)

### Overall MEDDPICC Score: 53/80 (66%) - DOWN from 70%

**Assessment**: Opportunity value doubled but win probability decreased. Must address champion gap and competitive positioning urgently.

## Strategic Options Discussed

### Option A: Full Strategic Pursuit
- Dedicate full specialist team
- Executive sponsor engagement (SVP level)
- Custom POC environment for OT/ICS
- Aggressive competitive response
- **Investment**: ~$150K pursuit cost
- **Probability**: 45% → target 60%

### Option B: Standard Pursuit with Enhancements
- Current team with specialist support
- Director-level executive engagement
- Enhanced POC scope
- Standard competitive response
- **Investment**: ~$50K pursuit cost
- **Probability**: 35%

### Option C: Qualified Withdrawal
- Acknowledge competitive disadvantage
- Focus on protecting observability base
- Position for future if LegacySIEM fails
- **Investment**: Minimal
- **Probability**: N/A (no active pursuit)

## Decision: OPTION A - Full Strategic Pursuit

**Robert Chen (VP Sales)**:
> "This is exactly the kind of deal that defines market presence. €3M budget, board visibility, acquisition integration - if we win this, it's a reference for every manufacturing prospect in EMEA. We're going all in."

**Approved Resources:**
- Nina Kowalski: Full-time through POC (Jan-Mar)
- Additional Security Specialist: OT/ICS expert (request submitted)
- Executive Sponsor: SVP Engineering (pending confirmation)
- POC Environment: Dedicated OT/ICS lab setup
- Travel Budget: Weekly on-site presence authorized

## Competitive Strategy

### Against LegacySIEM

| LegacySIEM Claim | Our Counter |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Incumbent, no migration risk" | Migration creates technical debt, delays unified visibility |
| "Contract consolidation" | TCO still higher, no observability integration |
| "Klaus knows LegacySIEM" | Platform familiarity ≠ best platform for combined entity |
| "Proven at scale" | Platform proven at ACME for 3 years, same scale |

### Key Messages

1. **Unified Platform**: "One platform for observability AND security - LegacySIEM can't offer this"
2. **TCO Advantage**: "Even with migration, 3-year TCO is 30% lower"
3. **Integration Value**: "Leverage your existing platform investment, don't strand it"
4. **Future-Proof**: "Open platform, no vendor lock-in vs. LegacySIEM's proprietary model"

## Account Team Assignments

| Role | Owner | Responsibility |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Deal Lead | Alex Thompson | Overall coordination, commercial |
| Technical Lead | Maria Santos | Architecture, integration, POC design |
| OT/ICS Lead | Nina Kowalski | Specialist POC, Industrietechnik research |
| Executive Sponsor | James Park → SVP | Klaus relationship, CTO alignment |
| Competitive Intel | CI Team | LegacySIEM response monitoring |

## Revised Action Plan

## Risk Register Updates Required

**New Critical Risks:**
1. CISO with LegacySIEM bias controls technical decision
2. Timeline compressed 50% with scope doubled
3. Champion influence diluted

**Upgraded Risks:**
1. Competitive threat: LegacySIEM → CRITICAL (was HIGH)
2. Timeline pressure → CRITICAL (was MEDIUM)

**Mitigated Risks:**
1. Budget concerns → CLOSED (€3M allocated)
2. No CTO access → CLOSED (direct engagement established)

## Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Action | Owner |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Klaus schedules LegacySIEM POC before ours | SVP intervention | Robert Chen |
| POC proposal rejected | Executive call to Marcus | James Park |
| Resource conflict | VP arbitration | Robert Chen |
| LegacySIEM pricing below cost | Commercial escalation | James Park |

## Success Metrics for This Pursuit

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Klaus sentiment | Neutral → Supportive | Post-1:1 assessment |
| POC acceptance | Proposal accepted by Jan 20 | Customer confirmation |
| POC success rate | 100% criteria met | Scorecard |
| Competitive win | Selected over LegacySIEM | Decision |
| Deal close | Contract by Q3 2026 | Signed agreement |

## Next Review

- **Date**: January 23, 2026
