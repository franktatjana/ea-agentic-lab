# ACME Corp Deal Review - Analytics Consolidation

## Summary

Internal deal review following yesterday's discovery call. Opportunity looks solid with clear pain points and executive champion. Thomas Richter is driving the initiative with FY2026 budget approved.

## Opportunity Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Budget | $500K approved for FY2026 | 8/10 |
| Authority | VP Data is sponsor and champion | 8/10 |
| Need | Clear pain (tool sprawl, cost, productivity) | 9/10 |
| Timeline | Q1 2026 decision, H1 deployment | 7/10 |
| Competition | No active evaluations (we are first) | 9/10 |

**Overall Score: 8.2/10 - Strong qualified opportunity**

## Deal Details

- **ARR Potential**: $420K
- **Services**: $80K migration services
- **Close Target**: January 2026
- **Stage**: Discovery / Evaluation

## Win Strategy

James outlined the approach:

1. **Speed** - We're first; move fast before Databricks/Snowflake enters
2. **Unified Platform** - Leverage existing observability relationship
3. **TCO** - 35% savings is compelling
4. **Champion** - Thomas is strong, but single-threaded risk

Alex noted: "Thomas is our only executive champion. Dr. Chen is supportive but analytics isn't her domain. We need to build more relationships."

James: "Agreed. Let's plan to multi-thread. Can we get a CTO meeting for analytics specifically?"

Alex: "I'll work on it through Dr. Chen, but it's lower priority than security right now."

*Note: This multi-threading action was deprioritized in favor of the larger security deal. In retrospect, this was a mistake.*

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Single champion dependency | Medium | Critical | Multi-thread (deprioritized) |
| Databricks/Snowflake entry | Medium | High | Speed, differentiation |
| Tableau migration complexity | Medium | Medium | Phased approach |
| User adoption resistance | Low | Medium | POC user testing |

## Resource Needs

- Maria Santos: 50% time through POC
- POC environment: Standard provisioning
- No specialist needed (standard analytics use case)

James approved all requests.

## Actions

- [ ] Alex: Register opportunity in CRM
- [ ] Maria: Begin POC environment provisioning
- [ ] Alex: Schedule technical deep-dive for October
- [ ] Alex: Explore CTO analytics conversation through Dr. Chen

## Next Steps

Technical deep-dive October 8th. POC target kickoff early November.
