# ACME Corp Deal Review - Analytics POC Progress

## Summary

Mid-POC deal review. Strong technical progress, 3 of 5 use cases completed successfully. Thomas Richter remains engaged and positive. Team confident in POC success.

## POC Status

| Use Case | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Executive Dashboard | Complete | 2.3s load on 120M rows |
| Real-Time Pipeline | Complete | Sub-10s Kafka ingestion |
| Self-Service BI | In Progress | Lars testing this week |
| Tableau Migration | In Progress | Assessment complete |
| Data Engineering | Not Started | Week 4 |

Maria: "We're tracking ahead of schedule. The real-time pipeline demo was the highlight, Thomas was very impressed."

## Pipeline Update

- **ARR**: $420K (unchanged)
- **Probability**: 65% (up from 55%)
- **Close Target**: January 2026
- **Stage**: Technical Evaluation (POC)

## Multi-Threading Status

Alex: "I still haven't secured a CTO conversation for analytics specifically. Dr. Chen says Marcus sees analytics as Thomas's domain and doesn't want to get involved."

James: "That's concerning. What if Thomas leaves?"

Alex: "Low probability. He's been here 3 years and just got his team expanded."

James: "Fair point, but let's keep trying. Can Lars Becker be a secondary champion?"

Alex: "Lars is supportive but he's a team lead, not an executive. His influence is limited."

*Note: This exchange shows the multi-threading risk was discussed but not adequately addressed. The team underestimated the probability of champion departure.*

## Competitive Intelligence

No competitive activity detected. No DataForge or FrostByte engagement at ACME for analytics.

Alex: "We're still the only game in town. No competitive pressure."

## Actions

- [ ] Maria: Complete use cases 3-5 by December 12
- [ ] Alex: Continue CTO engagement attempt
- [ ] Alex: Prepare commercial proposal framework for January
- [ ] Maria: Schedule POC review meeting for December 18

## Next Steps

POC review December 18th with Thomas Richter. Commercial proposal to follow in January.
