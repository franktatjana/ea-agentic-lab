# Field Notes: Post-POC Review Assessment

## Situation Assessment

Just finished the POC review meeting with Anna Bergmann 2 days ago. The technical results were strong (85% criteria met), but the room felt different without Thomas. Anna was polite but clearly comparing everything to DataForge.

## Key Observations

1. **Anna's body language**: Polite but disengaged. She was asking questions to check boxes, not because she was excited about what we showed.

2. **Lars Becker's frustration**: Lars genuinely liked our platform. He pulled me aside after the meeting and said "I really hope Anna gives this a fair shake." That tells me Lars sees what we see, Anna isn't evaluating objectively.

3. **Dr. Chen's limited help**: Sarah was supportive in the meeting but told me privately that analytics is "Anna's call" and she won't override a peer's domain decision. We can't count on Dr. Chen to rescue this.

4. **DataForge already in motion**: I checked LinkedIn and Anna connected with a DataForge AE last week. She's not just evaluating, she's already engaging them.

## Honest Assessment

I think we're going to lose this deal. The POC results don't matter when the decision maker has 3 years of emotional investment in a competing platform. Anna isn't going to take a risk on an unfamiliar platform when she's new in her CDO role.

Our best shot is the CTO escalation. If Marcus Weber insists on a fair evaluation, we might get a level playing field. But Marcus has been hands-off on analytics.

## Next Steps

- Push James to get the CTO meeting for analytics
- Prepare the DataForge comparison document (be honest about strengths and weaknesses)
- Keep Lars engaged as a potential future ally
- Accept that we may need to play the long game and revisit in 12-18 months
