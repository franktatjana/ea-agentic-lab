# COMPETITIVE SUMMARY
# ============================================================================
summary:
  threat_level: "lost"
  primary_competitor: "Databricks"
  competitive_status: "Closed Lost"
  final_outcome: "Databricks selected by new CDO"
  key_factor: "Relationship bias, not technical merit"

  headline: |
    Deal was lost to Databricks when new CDO Anna Bergmann was appointed
    in December 2025. She had 3 years of Databricks experience at her
    previous company and chose it over our technically superior POC results.

# ============================================================================
# WINNING COMPETITOR: DATABRICKS

databricks:
  threat_level: "won"
  relationship_strength: "strong"

  how_they_won:
    entry_point: "New CDO's prior relationship"
    timeline:
      - date: "2025-12-01"
        event: "Anna Bergmann appointed CDO, former Databricks user"
      - date: "2025-12-10"
        event: "Anna contacted Databricks AE from previous company"
      - date: "2025-12-20"
        event: "Databricks provided tailored proposal"
      - date: "2026-01-05"
        event: "Internal decision made for Databricks"
      - date: "2026-01-10"
        event: "Official selection communicated"

    relationship:
      primary_contact: "Anna Bergmann (CDO)"
      relationship_tenure: "3 years (from previous company)"
      relationship_quality: "Strong personal and professional trust"
      databricks_certifications: "Anna holds Databricks Certified Data Engineer"

    strengths:
      - "Pre-existing trusted relationship with decision maker"
      - "CDO had 3 years hands-on experience"
      - "Strong data engineering and ML story"
      - "Lakehouse architecture alignment with CDO's vision"
      - "Faster perceived time-to-value due to familiarity"

    weaknesses:
      - "No existing ACME footprint"
      - "Higher total cost at scale"
      - "No observability integration"
      - "Weaker self-service BI capabilities"
      - "Requires additional BI tool for end-user dashboards"

    why_weaknesses_didnt_matter: |
      The CDO prioritized speed and certainty over technical capability.
      Her existing knowledge of Databricks eliminated the learning curve
      and reduced perceived risk, which mattered more than our POC
      demonstrating superior analytics UX.

# ============================================================================
# LOSS LESSONS
# ============================================================================
loss_lessons:
  tactical:
    - lesson: "Relationship-based decisions cannot be overcome by POC results alone"
      application: "Build executive relationships early, before they become urgent"

    - lesson: "New decision makers arrive with pre-formed vendor preferences"
      application: "Monitor for leadership changes, engage within 48 hours"

    - lesson: "Single-threaded champion is a critical vulnerability"
      application: "Require multi-threaded engagement in every deal"

  strategic:
    - lesson: "Analytics market perception of platform still skews toward search/observability"
      application: "Invest in analytics-first messaging and case studies"

    - lesson: "Databricks relationship network is strong in DACH market"
      application: "Build competitive intelligence on Databricks relationship patterns"
