## Horizon 1: Core Business (Now - 6 months)

**Current State:** ACME uses 4 fragmented analytics tools generating $475K annual spend.

**Immediate Opportunity:**
- Analytics platform consolidation ($420K ARR)
- Tableau + Power BI displacement
- Self-service analytics for 350 users
- Crystal Reports retirement

**Revenue Impact:** $420K new ARR

**Risks:**
- Single champion dependency (Thomas Richter)
- Tableau migration complexity (200+ dashboards)
- User adoption resistance

## Horizon 2: Growth (6-18 months)

**Expansion Potential:**
- Data engineering workloads (ETL/ELT pipelines)
- Advanced analytics and data science integration
- Cross-platform integration with observability data
- Additional business unit rollout

**Revenue Impact:** $200K additional ARR

**Dependencies:**
- Successful H1 deployment
- Data engineering team adoption
- Security node data correlation

## Horizon 3: Future (18-36 months)

**Long-term Vision:**
- ML/AI analytics capabilities
- Predictive manufacturing analytics
- Real-time operational intelligence
- Full data platform consolidation

**Revenue Impact:** $300K additional ARR

**Dependencies:**
- H1 + H2 success
- ML/AI product maturity
- Customer data strategy evolution

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Horizon | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|---------|----------|------------|
| Single champion | H1 | High | Multi-thread engagement |
| Migration complexity | H1 | Medium | Phased migration plan |
| Data engineering competition | H2 | High | DataForge/FrostByte threat |
| ML maturity | H3 | Medium | Product roadmap alignment |

**Note (Post-Mortem):** The H1 "single champion" risk materialized and was fatal to the deal.
The H2 "data engineering competition" risk materialized through the CDO appointment.
