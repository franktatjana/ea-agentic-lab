## Strengths

| # | Strength | Evidence |
|---|----------|----------|
| S1 | Existing ACME relationship | 3-year observability partnership, $3.5M ARR |
| S2 | Unified platform value | Single platform for search, observability, and analytics |
| S3 | Superior self-service UX | Demonstrated in initial demos, business user accessible |
| S4 | TCO advantage | 35% cost reduction vs. current tools ($165K savings) |
| S5 | Strong champion | Thomas Richter actively driving consolidation |

## Weaknesses

| # | Weakness | Mitigation |
|---|----------|------------|
| W1 | Analytics market perception | Platform perceived as search/observability first |
| W2 | Limited data engineering depth | Weaker vs. DataForge/FrostByte on Spark workloads |
| W3 | Single-threaded engagement | Only Thomas Richter as executive contact |
| W4 | Dashboard migration tooling | Auto-migration covers 75%, not 100% |

## Opportunities

| # | Opportunity | Timeline |
|---|-------------|----------|
| O1 | Tool consolidation budget approved | FY2026 |
| O2 | Cross-sell from observability success | Immediate |
| O3 | Real-time analytics differentiation | POC phase |
| O4 | Crystal Reports end-of-life forcing change | 6 months |

## Threats

| # | Threat | Severity | Probability |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|
| T1 | Champion departure | High | Low |
| T2 | DataForge/FrostByte entry | High | Medium |
| T3 | Power BI bundling with M365 | Medium | Medium |
| T4 | Budget reallocation | High | Low |

## Strategic Implications

**Primary Strategy:** Win through unified platform value and existing relationship leverage.

**Critical Watch Items:**
1. Champion health (Thomas Richter engagement signals)
2. Competitive entry (DataForge, FrostByte)
3. Budget commitment stability

**Post-Mortem Notes:**
- T1 (Champion departure) materialized on 2025-11-28, rated as "Low probability" but was fatal
- T2 (DataForge entry) materialized through CDO appointment, not through market activity
- T4 (Budget reallocation) materialized as consequence of T1 + T2
- Lesson: "Low probability, high impact" threats need contingency plans, not just monitoring
