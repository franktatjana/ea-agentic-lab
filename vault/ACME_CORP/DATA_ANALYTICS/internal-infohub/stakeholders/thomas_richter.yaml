# Impact of Departure
departure_impact:
  deal_impact: "critical"
  description: |
    Thomas was the sole executive champion driving the analytics
    consolidation initiative. His departure created a vacuum that
    was filled by a new CDO with a competing vendor preference.

  what_was_lost:
    - "Internal advocacy for our platform"
    - "Executive-level budget approval support"
    - "Technical vision alignment"
    - "POC success narrative to leadership"

  lessons:
    - "Multi-thread beyond a single champion"
    - "Build CTO-level relationship independently"
    - "Establish user-level champions as backup advocates"
    - "Monitor for departure signals (LinkedIn activity, recruiter contact)"

# Notes
notes:
  - date: "2025-11-28"
    author: "Alex Thompson"
    note: "Received call that Thomas has resigned. Accepted CDO role elsewhere. No formal handover of analytics initiative. This is a critical risk to the deal."
  - date: "2025-09-15"
    author: "Alex Thompson"
    note: "Strong first impression. Thomas is frustrated with current analytics tooling and has clear vision for consolidation. He's our champion."
  - date: "2025-11-12"
    author: "Maria Santos"
    note: "Thomas deeply engaged in POC kickoff. Knows his data architecture well. Set aggressive but fair success criteria."
