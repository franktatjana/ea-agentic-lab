  initiative_name: "Data Analytics Platform Consolidation"
  initiative_type: "Tool Consolidation"
  outcome: "LOST - DataForge selected"

  background: |
    ACME Corporation's data analytics landscape had grown organically over
    5 years, resulting in fragmented tooling across Tableau, Power BI,
    custom Python scripts, and legacy reporting systems. The VP of Data &
    Analytics, Thomas Richter, initiated a consolidation project to
    unify analytics onto a single platform.

    The initiative was well-supported through discovery and evaluation,
    with a successful POC demonstrating 85% of success criteria. However,
    when Thomas Richter departed in late November 2025, the incoming CDO
    Anna Bergmann brought a strong preference for DataForge from her
    previous role. Budget was reallocated in January 2026.
