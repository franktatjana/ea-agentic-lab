  - stakeholder_id: "STK_THOMAS_RICHTER"
    name: "Thomas Richter"
    title: "VP Data & Analytics (former)"
    company: "ACME Corporation"
    location: "Munich, Germany"
    stance: "champion"
    status: "departed"
    departure_date: "2025-11-28"

    relationship:
      status: "departed"
      owner: "Alex Thompson"
      sentiment: "highly_supportive"
      last_engagement: "2025-11-25"

    priorities:
      - "Analytics tool consolidation"
      - "Real-time data processing"
      - "Team productivity improvement"

    impact_of_departure: |
      Thomas was the sole executive champion for this initiative.
      His departure removed the internal advocate driving the project
      forward and left no one to defend the platform choice when Anna
      Bergmann was appointed.

    strategy: "N/A - departed"
    profile_link: "stakeholders/thomas_richter.yaml"

  - stakeholder_id: "STK_ANNA_BERGMANN"
    name: "Anna Bergmann"
    title: "Chief Data Officer"
    company: "ACME Corporation"
    location: "Munich, Germany"
    stance: "blocker"
    start_date: "2025-12-01"

    role_in_deal:
      type: "economic_buyer"
      influence: "critical"
      authority: "budget_approval_and_selection"
      engagement_priority: "critical"

    relationship:
      status: "new_contact"
      owner: "Alex Thompson"
      sentiment: "opposed"
      last_engagement: "2026-01-10"

    technology_context:
      databricks_experience: "3 years at previous company"
      platform_familiarity: "Low - brief demo only"
      key_quote: "I've used DataForge for three years. I know what it can do and I trust it."

    priorities:
      - "Quick time-to-value on analytics modernization"
      - "Proven platform she has experience with"
      - "Data engineering and ML capabilities"

    concerns:
      - "Unfamiliar with our platform capabilities"
      - "Risk aversion to unknown platform"
      - "Pressure to deliver results quickly in new role"

    why_we_lost: |
      Anna had a strong pre-existing relationship with DataForge from
      her previous role. She felt comfortable with a known platform and
      was unwilling to take the risk on an unfamiliar one, especially
      given the pressure to deliver results quickly in her new CDO role.

    strategy: "Attempted rescue engagement, unsuccessful"

    - from: "Lars Becker"
      to: "Anna Bergmann"
      type: "operational_input"
      strength: "low"
      notes: "Lars had limited influence on new CDO"

      type: "recommendation"
      strength: "high"

      to: "Anna Bergmann"
      type: "peer_influence"
      strength: "low"
      notes: "Analytics not in Dr. Chen's primary scope"

  key_relationships:
    - relationship: "Thomas → Anna"
      status: "no_handover"
      impact: "Thomas left before Anna was hired, no advocacy transfer"

    - relationship: "Anna → DataForge AE"
      status: "strong_pre_existing"
      impact: "Anna brought DataForge relationship from previous company"

# ============================================================================
# ENGAGEMENT GAPS (Post-Mortem)
# ============================================================================
engagement_gaps:
  fatal:
    - gap: "No backup champion after Thomas departure"
      impact: "Deal had no internal advocate during critical decision phase"
      lesson: "Always multi-thread beyond primary champion"

    - gap: "No executive relationship above Thomas"
      impact: "Could not escalate to CTO to protect deal"
      lesson: "Build executive coverage at CTO/CEO level early"

  significant:
    - gap: "Late engagement with Anna Bergmann"
      impact: "DataForge had a 3-year head start on relationship"
      lesson: "When new decision makers arrive, prioritize immediate engagement"

    - gap: "Lars Becker (user buyer) not elevated"
      impact: "Strong user support couldn't translate to decision influence"
      lesson: "Invest in elevating user buyer voice in purchasing process"
