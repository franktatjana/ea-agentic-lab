# STAKEHOLDER JOURNEYS

stakeholder_journeys:
  thomas_richter:
    persona: "VP Data & Analytics (Champion)"
    final_status: "departed"
    journey_stage: "N/A - Left company"

    journey_arc:
      - phase: "Champion Identification"
        date: "2025-09-15"
        mindset: "Frustrated with tool sprawl, actively seeking solution"
        key_moment: "Discovery call, articulated pain clearly"
        quote: "We're drowning in tools."

      - phase: "Technical Alignment"
        date: "2025-10-08"
        mindset: "Excited about platform capabilities"
        key_moment: "Technical deep-dive validated architecture fit"

      - phase: "POC Sponsorship"
        date: "2025-11-12"
        mindset: "Fully committed, driving internal support"
        key_moment: "POC kickoff with clear success criteria"
        quote: "If this POC delivers, I'll push for board approval."

      - phase: "Departure"
        date: "2025-11-28"
        mindset: "N/A"
        key_moment: "Resigned, accepted CDO role elsewhere"

    impact_of_departure: |
      Thomas was the sole executive champion. His departure created
      a power vacuum that was filled by a CDO with competing vendor
      preference. No backup champion had been cultivated.

  anna_bergmann:
    persona: "CDO (New Decision Maker)"
    final_status: "selected_competitor"
    journey_stage: "Decision - Selected Databricks"

    journey_arc:
      - phase: "Appointment"
        date: "2025-12-01"
        mindset: "Bringing proven approaches from previous role"

      - phase: "Introduction"
        date: "2025-12-15"
        mindset: "Polite but guarded, Databricks bias evident"
        key_moment: "First meeting, multiple Databricks references"
        quote: "I've used Databricks for three years. I know what it can do."

      - phase: "POC Review"
        date: "2025-12-18"
        mindset: "Acknowledged results but compared to Databricks"
        key_moment: "Asked how we compare to Databricks on every dimension"

      - phase: "Decision"
        date: "2026-01-10"
        mindset: "Confident in Databricks choice"
        key_moment: "Communicated selection of Databricks"
        quote: "Your platform is impressive, but I'm going with what I know."

    why_we_couldnt_convert: |
      Anna's 3-year Databricks relationship, combined with the
      pressure to deliver results quickly in a new CDO role,
      made her risk-averse. Our platform was an unknown, and
      the POC results alone couldn't overcome familiarity bias.

  lars_becker:
    persona: "Analytics Team Lead (User Buyer)"
    final_status: "supportive_but_overruled"

    journey_arc:
      - phase: "Technical Evaluation"
        date: "2025-10-08"
        mindset: "Open and curious"

      - phase: "POC Participant"
        date: "2025-11-12"
        mindset: "Impressed by self-service capabilities"
        key_moment: "Created dashboard independently during POC"
        quote: "The self-service experience is genuinely better than anything we have today."

      - phase: "Overruled"
        date: "2026-01-10"
        mindset: "Disappointed but accepted CDO decision"

    lesson: "User-level support without executive backing is insufficient"
