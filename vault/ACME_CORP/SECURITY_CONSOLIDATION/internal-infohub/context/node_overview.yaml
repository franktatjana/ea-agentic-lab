business_context:
  initiative_name: "Security Platform Consolidation"
  initiative_type: "Strategic Expansion"

  background: |
    ACME Corporation, a leading industrial automation company, has been a
    Platform customer since 2024 for observability. Following ACME's acquisition
    of Industrietechnik GmbH (announced January 2026), the combined entity
    requires a unified security platform across 20 manufacturing plants.

    The project initially targeted 8 ACME plants ($800K ARR) but has expanded
    to include 12 Industrietechnik plants, resulting in a $1.75M ARR opportunity.

    This initiative is board-visible and critical to ACME's post-acquisition
    integration success.
