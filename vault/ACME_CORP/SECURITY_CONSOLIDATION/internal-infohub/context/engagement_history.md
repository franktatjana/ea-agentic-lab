## Key Engagements

### 2026-01-15 | CTO Strategic Shift Meeting
**Type:** External - Customer Meeting
**Attendees:** Marcus Weber (CTO), Klaus Hoffman (CISO), Dr. Sarah Chen, Alex Thompson, Maria Santos, James Park
**Outcome:** CRITICAL - Situation changed fundamentally

**Summary:**
- Industrietechnik acquisition announced, doubling deal scope
- Klaus Hoffman (new CISO from Industrietechnik) introduced
- Timeline compressed to 6 months (was 12 months)
- €3M budget allocated by board
- Scope expanded from 8 to 20 plants

**Key Moments:**
1. Marcus Weber: *"We need one platform, one team, one dashboard. The board expects integration within six months."*
2. Klaus Hoffman: *"I'm pragmatic. Show me it works, I'll support it."*
3. Klaus Hoffman: *"Show me a POC that covers OT/ICS at scale - not 8 plants, but 20"*
4. Dr. Chen advocated for the platform: *"Klaus, I need to share our experience. The platform stability, the integration capabilities, the cost model - it's been transformational."*

**Risks Identified:**
- Klaus has veto power and 5-year LegacySIEM background
- LegacySIEM presenting consolidation proposal next week
- Timeline is aggressive for 2.5x scope increase

**Action Items:**
- James Park: 1:1 with Klaus (Jan 19)
- Alex Thompson: Revised POC proposal (Jan 17)
- Maria Santos: OT/ICS POC environment setup (Jan 27)
