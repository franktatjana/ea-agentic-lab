competitive_moves:
  - competitor: "LegacySIEM"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    news: "LegacySIEM Cloud Migration: Enterprise customers report 40% longer migration times than projected"
    source: "Reddit r/sysadmin, Gartner Peer Insights"
    confidence: "reported"
    our_response: |
      Validates our cloud-native advantage. During next technical discussion
      with Klaus, share cloud deployment benchmarks. Do not attack LegacySIEM
      directly, but highlight our cloud-native architecture story.
    urgency: "THIS_WEEK"

  - competitor: "LegacySIEM"
    date: "2026-02-04"
    news: "LegacySIEM announces 'LegacySIEM Security Cloud' GA with per-workload pricing"
    source: "LegacySIEM press release"
    confidence: "confirmed"
    our_response: |
      New pricing model could reduce LegacySIEM's TCO disadvantage at small
      scale but likely increases cost at ACME's 20-plant volume. Update TCO
      analysis with new pricing model for comparison.
    urgency: "NEXT_REVIEW"

  - competitor: "Microsoft"
    date: "2026-02-08"
    news: "Microsoft Sentinel adds manufacturing-specific analytics rules in February update"
    source: "Microsoft blog"
    confidence: "confirmed"
    our_response: |
      Microsoft strengthening manufacturing vertical play. Monitor whether
      ACME's Azure footprint creates Sentinel evaluation pressure. Our
      differentiation: unified observability+security and on-prem OT capability.
    urgency: "MONITOR"
