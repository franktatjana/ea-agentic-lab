# Security Platform Consolidation

## Objective

Unify ACME Corporation's security operations across 20 manufacturing plants (8 ACME + 12 Industrietechnik) onto a single platform, replacing 12 fragmented security tools.

## Why Now

Following ACME's acquisition of Industrietechnik GmbH (January 2026), the combined entity needs unified security visibility across all plants. The board has mandated integration within six months, and the existing LegacySIEM contract expires September 2026.

## What We're Solving

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| 12 separate security tools | No unified threat visibility |
| Two separate SOC workflows | Slower incident response |
| LegacySIEM cost ($450K/yr) | High per-GB pricing at scale |
| No OT/ICS security coverage | Manufacturing blind spots |
| Manual correlation | Delayed threat detection |

## Expected Outcomes

- **Single pane of glass** for security across all 20 plants
- **30% cost reduction** ($660K annual savings vs. current tooling)
- **Real-time threat detection** with sub-second query response
- **OT/ICS visibility** for manufacturing environments
- **Unified dashboard** combining observability and security data

## Next Steps

1. Finalize POC scope and success criteria (by Jan 20)
2. Kick off 7-week POC (Jan 27)
3. Mid-POC checkpoint (Feb 15)
4. POC results review and recommendation (Mar 15)
