# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
# ============================================================================
executive_summary:
  objective: |
    Demonstrate our Security solution's capability to serve as the unified security
    platform for ACME Corporation's combined entity (20 manufacturing plants)
    following the Industrietechnik acquisition.

  value_proposition:
    - "30% TCO reduction through tool consolidation"
    - "Unified observability + security platform"
    - "OT/ICS security at manufacturing scale"
    - "Accelerated post-acquisition integration"

  success_definition: |
    POC is successful when Klaus Hoffman (CISO) endorses our Security solution as the
    recommended platform for the combined entity, based on proven OT/ICS capability,
    scale demonstration, and clear migration path from LegacySIEM.

  key_metrics:
    detection_rate: "≥95%"
    query_performance: "<1 second"
    scale_proof: "20-plant equivalent load"
    tco_savings: "≥30%"
