# Identify Technical Champion Before POC

Never start a POC without a confirmed technical champion on the customer side. A technical champion is someone who will actively advocate for the solution internally, has hands-on access to the evaluation environment, and will invest personal effort in making the POC succeed.

## Why This Works

POCs without a technical champion have a 30% lower win rate. The champion provides three critical functions: they unblock technical access issues quickly, they translate our value proposition into internal language, and they give us early warning when competitive dynamics shift.

## How to Identify

Look for these signals during discovery and qualification:
- Asks detailed technical questions beyond what their role requires
- Volunteers information about internal architecture and pain points
- Suggests additional use cases beyond the original scope
- Introduces you to other team members proactively
- Responds to emails and Slack messages within hours, not days

## When a Champion Is Missing

If no champion emerges during discovery, escalate to Account Executive before committing POC resources. Options include:
- Propose a shorter, lower-commitment "technical workshop" instead of a full POC
- Request a joint architecture session to identify the right technical counterpart
- Pause and re-engage when organizational readiness improves

## Watch Outs

- A champion who is too junior may not have the access or influence to drive adoption. Validate they can actually get things done.
- Multiple champions can lead to conflicting priorities. Identify one primary champion and align expectations.
