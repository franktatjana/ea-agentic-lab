# Multi-Stakeholder Deals Need Separate Tracks

When an engagement involves more than two distinct stakeholder groups (e.g., Security Operations, Platform Engineering, and Executive Sponsors), run separate communication tracks rather than trying to address everyone in combined meetings.

## What Happened

In a large consolidation deal, combined meetings with security analysts, platform architects, and CIO staff created confusion. Technical depth frustrated executives. Executive-level discussions left engineers feeling excluded from decisions affecting their workflows. The deal stalled for 6 weeks until tracks were separated.

## The Pattern

Successful multi-stakeholder engagements use three parallel tracks:
1. **Technical track**: Deep-dive sessions with engineering teams, hands-on workshops, architecture reviews
2. **Business track**: Executive briefings, ROI discussions, strategic alignment, vendor governance
3. **Bridge sessions**: Periodic all-hands where technical findings are translated into business outcomes

Each track has its own cadence, materials, and success criteria.

## When to Apply

- More than 2 distinct persona groups are involved in evaluation
- Meeting feedback suggests "too technical" or "too high-level" complaints
- Decision-making is slow despite positive individual feedback
- Customer has formal procurement or vendor governance processes
