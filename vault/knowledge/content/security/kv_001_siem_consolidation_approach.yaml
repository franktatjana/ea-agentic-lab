# Security Consolidation: Start with SIEM Integration

When approaching security consolidation deals, SIEM integration consistently proves to be the highest-impact quick win. Customers with fragmented security tooling respond well to a phased approach that starts with log aggregation before moving to advanced analytics.

## Why This Works

SIEM integration provides immediate, visible value: a single pane of glass for security events that previously required checking multiple tools. This builds trust and momentum before tackling more complex consolidation phases.

Customers report 40-60% reduction in mean time to detect (MTTD) within the first 30 days of SIEM consolidation, which becomes a powerful reference point for the broader consolidation conversation.

## When to Apply

- Customer has 3+ security vendors generating logs
- There is executive pressure to reduce security tooling costs
- SOC team is overwhelmed by alert fatigue from multiple dashboards
- Customer is evaluating SIEM replacement or upgrade

## Watch Outs

- Do not position as "rip and replace" for existing SIEM. Frame as augmentation first, migration second.
- Ensure data retention requirements are understood before sizing. Compliance-driven retention (7 years for PCI) can significantly impact architecture.
- If customer has custom detection rules in existing SIEM, plan migration effort separately. This is often the hidden cost that delays projects.
