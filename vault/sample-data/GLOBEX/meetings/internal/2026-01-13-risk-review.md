# Globex Risk Review - URGENT

## Summary

Emergency risk review following yesterday's QBR. This account is at serious risk of churn. Need coordinated response across CS, Sales, Support, and SA.

## Account Health Assessment

**Health Score: RED (35/100)**

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Usage | 3/10 | 30% decline |
| Engagement | 2/10 | Champion departed, stakeholder disengaged |
| Support | 3/10 | Multiple escalations, poor perception |
| Value Realization | 4/10 | ROI unclear for recent period |
| Relationship | 4/10 | VP Ops frustrated, IT Director defensive |

## Root Cause Analysis

Amy led the analysis:

1. **Champion Departure (November)**
   - Michael Torres was the platform expert
   - No succession planning
   - Knowledge lost when he left

2. **Support Experience Degradation**
   - P1 took 6 hours (SLA: 4 hours)
   - No proactive outreach on issues
   - Documentation outdated for features they use

3. **Onboarding Gap**
   - New team members never properly trained
   - Usage concentrated in departed champion
   - No enablement after organizational change

4. **Competitive Pressure**
   - ObservabilityVendorA pursuing aggressively
   - Developers prefer ObservabilityVendorA APM
   - Price perception (ObservabilityVendorA positioned as cheaper)

## Financial Impact

| Scenario | ARR Impact | Probability |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Full Churn | -$180K | 30% |
| 50% Downsell | -$90K | 40% |
| Flat Renewal | $0 | 20% |
| Expansion | +$50K | 10% |

**Expected ARR at Risk: $108K**

James: "This is a significant account. We need to treat this as a save opportunity."

## Recovery Plan

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Executive Outreach**
   - James to call Robert Martinez directly
   - Apologize for support experience
   - Commit to dedicated support contact

2. **Support Remediation**
   - Assign dedicated TAM for 90 days
   - Review all open tickets
   - Proactive health monitoring

3. **Technical Value Recovery**
   - Health check assessment
   - Optimization recommendations
   - Quick wins identification

### Short-Term (30 Days)

4. **Champion Development**
   - Identify potential new champion(s)
   - Offer free certification training
   - Create internal user group

5. **Competitive Defense**
   - ObservabilityVendorA comparison deck
   - TCO analysis (we should win on TCO)
   - Highlight migration costs and risks

6. **Value Documentation**
   - Rebuild ROI model with current data
   - Create executive value summary
   - Quarterly business reviews (monthly until stable)

### Medium-Term (60 Days)

7. **Expansion Opportunity**
   - New use case discovery
   - Security observability interest?
   - Adjacent teams to engage

## Competitive Intelligence

Kevin researched ObservabilityVendorA positioning:

**ObservabilityVendorA Strengths (perceived)**:
- "Better" APM (developer perception)
- Single pane of glass messaging
- Aggressive discounting

**ObservabilityVendorA Weaknesses**:
- Higher cost at scale (their pricing model)
- Lock-in on proprietary agent
- Less flexible for security use cases

**Our Counter-Strategy**:
- Emphasize total cost at their data volume
- Highlight open standards advantage
- Demonstrate unified observability + security
- Reference customers who evaluated both

## Support Manager Commitments

- Assign Senior TAM (Rachel) as dedicated resource
- Weekly support review calls
- 30-day SLA improvement plan
- Executive escalation path clarified

## Risk Mitigation Assignments

| Action | Owner | Due Date |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Executive call to Robert | James | Jan 15 |
| Support review and remediation plan | Support Mgr | Jan 16 |
| Health check assessment | Kevin | Jan 19 |
| ObservabilityVendorA competitive deck | Kevin | Jan 19 |
| Champion identification workshop | Amy | Jan 22 |
| Updated ROI model | Amy | Jan 24 |

## Escalation

This account is escalated to:
- VP of Customer Success (weekly updates)
- CRO dashboard (at-risk tracking)

## Success Criteria

Account moved from RED to YELLOW by February 15th:
- Usage stabilized (not declining)
- NPS improved from current (assumed negative)
- Renewal commitment verbal by March 1st

## Next Steps

James calling Robert tomorrow. Health check on Saturday if needed.
