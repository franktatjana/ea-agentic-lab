# ACME Corp Deal Review - Security Consolidation

## Summary

Internal deal review following yesterday's discovery call. Opportunity looks strong with clear pain points and executive sponsorship. Need to move quickly as LegacySIEM renewal is in April.

## Opportunity Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Budget | Confirmed FY26 budget, $1.2M benchmark | 9/10 |
| Authority | CTO is sponsor, VP Eng is champion | 9/10 |
| Need | Clear pain (cost, scale, compliance) | 10/10 |
| Timeline | April LegacySIEM renewal, June go-live needed | 8/10 |
| Competition | LegacySIEM incumbent, no other active eval | 7/10 |

**Overall Score: 8.6/10 - Strong qualified opportunity**

## Deal Details

- **ARR Potential**: $650K (3-year term)
- **Services**: $150K migration services
- **Close Target**: February 28, 2026
- **Stage**: Technical Evaluation

## Win Strategy

James outlined the approach:

1. **Speed** - Get POC done before LegacySIEM can react
2. **TCO** - Hammer the 45% cost savings message
3. **Technical** - Win Jennifer, she's the key influencer
4. **Executive** - Keep Sarah engaged, she's driving this

Tom's assessment: "Jennifer has platform experience and is excited about the technology. She'll be our internal champion once we prove the migration path."

## Competitive Intelligence

Lisa shared intel on LegacySIEM relationship:
- ACME has been a LegacySIEM customer for 6 years
- LegacySIEM rep is aggressive, known for deep discounting
- They've already received a 25% discount offer to renew early
- Relationship is transactional, not strategic

**Expected LegacySIEM Counter-Moves:**
1. Discount to 40% below current pricing
2. Offer free professional services
3. FUD on migration complexity

**Our Response:**
1. Focus on total value, not just license cost
2. Emphasize cloud-native architecture advantage
3. Provide concrete migration plan with timeline

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| LegacySIEM counter-offer | High | Medium | Speed, value focus |
| Migration complexity | Medium | High | Proven methodology, references |
| Timeline pressure | Medium | High | Early start, phased approach |
| Budget change | Low | High | Multi-year commitment |

## Resource Needs

Tom requesting:
- Security specialist (Rachel) for detection engineering
- POC environment provisioning (priority)
- Reference customer connection (FinServ similar to ACME)

James approved all requests. This is a regional priority deal.

## Actions

- [ ] Lisa: Register opportunity in SFDC today
- [ ] Tom: Book technical deep-dive for next week
- [ ] James: Reach out to FinServ AE for reference
- [ ] Amy: Prepare success plan framework for post-sale

## Next Steps

Technical deep-dive scheduled for January 15th. POC target kickoff January 20th.
