executive_summary: |
  Critical competitive development: ObservabilityVendorA launches AI feature
  directly targeting Globex's AI-Ops use case. However, Globex's AI-Ops pivot
  and Platform v3 rewrite create a counter-opportunity if we position as the
  enterprise-grade AI-Ops observability partner. Market data supports advanced
  observability as strategic infrastructure, not commodity monitoring.

# ============================================================================
# COMPETITIVE MOVES
# ============================================================================
competitive_moves:
  - competitor: "ObservabilityVendorA"
    date: "2026-02-04"
    news: "ObservabilityVendorA launches 'ObservabilityVendorA AI' with automated root cause analysis and anomaly detection"
    source: "ObservabilityVendorA blog"
    confidence: "confirmed"
    our_response: |
      Direct threat to our renewal. ObservabilityVendorA AI targets exactly the
      use case Globex cares about. However, ObservabilityVendorA AI is SaaS-only, limited
      to their own telemetry data, and priced as premium add-on ($50K+).
      Our counter: open data model, works with any telemetry source, and
      integrated with existing ML pipelines.
    urgency: "IMMEDIATE"

  - competitor: "ObservabilityVendorA"
    date: "2026-01-20"
    news: "ObservabilityVendorA free tier adoption growing among Globex developers for new microservices"
    source: "Field intelligence"
    confidence: "reported"
    our_response: |
      Bottom-up adoption is the biggest threat. Developers choose ObservabilityVendorA
      for new services, creating momentum for standardization. Counter with
      developer experience story: our platform supports OpenTelemetry natively,
      no vendor lock-in, and enterprise features (RBAC, compliance, SLOs).
    urgency: "THIS_WEEK"

  - competitor: "Titanmetrics/Vizara (open source)"
    date: "2026-02-07"
    news: "Vizara Labs raises $200M Series E, announces Vizara Cloud AI features"
    source: "TechCrunch"
    confidence: "confirmed"
    our_response: |
      New VP Engineering James Park (ex-Netflix) may favor Vizara/Titanmetrics
      stack. Vizara Cloud AI announcement competes on AI-Ops narrative.
      Counter: enterprise support, unified platform, and no operational burden
      of managing open-source stack at scale.
    urgency: "NEXT_REVIEW"

# MARKET SIGNALS

market_signals:
  - signal: "AIOps market growing 35% CAGR to $5.2B by 2027"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    source: "Gartner"
    implication_for_deal: |
      Validates Globex's AI-Ops pivot. Positions advanced observability as
      strategic investment, not cost center. Frame our renewal as AI-Ops
      enablement, not monitoring subscription.

  - signal: "OpenTelemetry adoption reaches 65% of enterprises"
    date: "2026-02-08"
    source: "CNCF Survey 2026"
    implication_for_deal: |
      OpenTelemetry is the standard. Our native OTel support is a
      differentiator vs ObservabilityVendorA's proprietary agent model.
      Globex Platform v3 microservices rewrite is the right time to
      standardize on OTel with our platform as the backend.

  - signal: "Enterprise observability spend shifting from 'monitoring' to 'intelligence'"
    date: "2026-02-05"
    source: "Forrester"
    implication_for_deal: |
      Market moving from passive monitoring to active intelligence (AIOps,
      predictive, automated remediation). This is exactly where Globex
      wants to go. Position our platform as the intelligence layer.

talking_points:
  - "Your AI-Ops initiative needs unified telemetry. We provide metrics, logs, traces, and events in one platform, not just metrics like ObservabilityVendorA."
  - "OpenTelemetry is now adopted by 65% of enterprises. Our native OTel support means no vendor lock-in as you rewrite Platform v3."
  - "Gartner says best AIOps requires unified telemetry. We're the only platform that gives you that without stitching together multiple tools."
  - "The observability market is moving from monitoring to intelligence. Your AI-Ops pivot is exactly right. We can be the intelligence layer."
