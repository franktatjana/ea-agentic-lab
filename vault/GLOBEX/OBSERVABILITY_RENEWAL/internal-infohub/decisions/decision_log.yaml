  # ============ RECOVERY STRATEGY DECISIONS ============
  - decision_id: "GLX_DEC_001"
    date: "2026-01-18"
    title: "Escalate to VP Sales for Executive Intervention"
    description: "Escalate Globex account to VP Sales level given critical health score, champion departure, and competitive threat"
    context: "Health score dropped below 50, active competitive evaluation, no executive engagement"
    source: "PB_CS_301_health_triage"
    decision_maker: "James Park (Sales Director)"
    stakeholders:
      - "Regional VP Sales"
      - "CSM Team Lead"
    category: "strategic"
    status: "implemented"
    rationale: |
      - Health score critical (42), declining 16 points in 3 months
      - $180K ARR at risk with 4-month renewal window
      - Active competitive displacement (Vizara POC)
      - No champion, VP Engineering is detractor
      - Requires executive-level relationship reset
    implications:
      - "VP Sales personally involved in recovery"
      - "Weekly executive reviews on Globex"
      - "Budget for retention offers if needed"
    linked_risks:
      - "CHAMPION_DEPARTED"
      - "COMPETITOR_DISPLACEMENT"
      - "CFO_SPEND_SCRUTINY"

  - decision_id: "GLX_DEC_002"
    date: "2026-01-22"
    title: "Assign Dedicated Recovery Team"
    description: "Form cross-functional recovery team: AE, SA, dedicated support engineer, CSM"
    context: "Standard account management insufficient for severity of situation"
    source: "GLX_DEC_001"
    decision_maker: "Regional VP Sales"
    stakeholders:
      - "AE"
      - "SA Team Lead"
      - "Support Engineering Manager"
    category: "resource"
    status: "implemented"
    rationale: "Account requires focused attention across sales, technical, and support dimensions simultaneously"
    implications:
      - "Dedicated support engineer assigned to Globex"
      - "SA allocated 40% time for win-back activities"
      - "Weekly cross-functional standup"
    linked_risks:
      - "SUPPORT_SATISFACTION"
      - "USAGE_DECLINE"

  - decision_id: "GLX_DEC_003"
    date: "2026-01-25"
    title: "Competitive Response Strategy: Value, Not Price"
    description: "Counter Vizara evaluation through capability differentiation and TCO analysis, not price matching"
    context: "Vizara Cloud Pro is ~$45K/yr vs our $180K. Cannot win on price alone"
    source: "COMPETITOR_DISPLACEMENT"
    decision_maker: "Regional VP Sales"
    stakeholders:
      - "CI Agent"
      - "SA"
      - "Value Engineering"
    category: "competitive"
    status: "approved"
    rationale: |
      - Price matching would set precedent and still lose on OSS perception
      - Our differentiators (ML alerting, RBAC, compliance, unified obs+security) are genuine value
      - Vizara's enterprise gaps (SLA, support, governance) are real
      - TCO analysis shows we're competitive when factoring in hidden OSS costs
    implications:
      - "No price-only counter-offers"
      - "TCO + capability comparison as primary weapon"
      - "Executive ROI presentation for CFO"
      - "Free advanced workshop to demonstrate value"
    linked_risks:
      - "COMPETITOR_DISPLACEMENT"
      - "CFO_SPEND_SCRUTINY"

  - decision_id: "GLX_DEC_004"
    date: "2026-01-28"
    title: "Pursue IT Director as New Champion"
    description: "Invest relationship-building effort in Rachel Torres (IT Director) as potential replacement champion"
    context: "Need internal advocate. IT Director has shown openness and understands enterprise observability value"
    source: "CHAMPION_DEPARTED"
    decision_maker: "AE"
    stakeholders:
      - "CSM"
      - "SA"
    category: "stakeholder"
    status: "approved"
    rationale: |
      - Rachel Torres expressed concern about Vizara migration complexity
      - Has cross-functional visibility (IT, Ops, Development)
      - Understands compliance and governance requirements
      - Can influence VP Engineering through IT governance lens
    implications:
      - "Prioritize Rachel relationship in all engagements"
      - "Provide her with executive-ready materials she can present internally"
      - "Offer her team exclusive preview of AI-Ops roadmap"
    linked_risks:
      - "CHAMPION_DEPARTED"

  - decision_id: "GLX_DEC_005"
    date: "2026-02-01"
    title: "Offer Restructured Pricing for Renewal"
    description: "Propose usage-based pricing model that reduces headline cost while maintaining ARR through adoption recovery"
    context: "CFO review flagged high cost-per-user. Need pricing narrative that works with current usage reality"
    source: "CFO_SPEND_SCRUTINY"
    decision_maker: "Regional VP Sales"
    stakeholders:
      - "AE"
      - "Deal Desk"
      - "Finance"
    category: "commercial"
    status: "approved"
    rationale: |
      - Current per-seat model penalizes usage decline
      - Usage-based model aligns cost with value perception
      - Recovery plan should drive usage up, naturally increasing ARR
      - Shows flexibility and partnership, not rigid vendor behavior
    implications:
      - "Deal desk to model usage-based pricing options"
      - "Present as part of renewal proposal, not reactive discount"
      - "Include usage recovery milestones tied to pricing tiers"
    linked_risks:
      - "CFO_SPEND_SCRUTINY"
      - "CONTRACT_TIMELINE"

  - decision_id: "GLX_DEC_006"
    date: "2026-02-03"
    title: "Request CTO Meeting for AI-Ops Alignment"
    description: "Request meeting with Globex CTO to align our AI-Ops observability capabilities with their strategic direction"
    context: "CTO announced AI-Ops initiative. Opportunity to reframe platform value beyond traditional observability"
    source: "AIOPS_PIVOT"
    decision_maker: "AE"
    category: "strategic"
    status: "pending_approval"
    rationale: "AI-Ops pivot is an opportunity to reset the conversation from cost to strategic value"
    implications:
      - "Requires VP-level introduction to CTO"
      - "Need product team to brief on AI-Ops roadmap"
      - "Could shift conversation from 'expensive monitoring' to 'strategic AI infrastructure'"
    linked_risks:
      - "AIOPS_PIVOT"
      - "CHAMPION_DEPARTED"
