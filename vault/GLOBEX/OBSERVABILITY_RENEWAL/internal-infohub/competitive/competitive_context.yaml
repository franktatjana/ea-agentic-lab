# ============================================================================
# COMPETITIVE SUMMARY
# ============================================================================
summary:
  threat_level: "critical"
  primary_competitor: "ObservabilityVendorA"
  competitive_status: "Active displacement threat"
  win_probability: "30%"
  key_battleground: "Developer adoption vs. enterprise reliability"

  headline: |
    ObservabilityVendorA is gaining bottom-up developer adoption through free tier.
    New VP Engineering (James Park, ex-Netflix) likely favors OSS stack. Champion
    departure and declining usage create urgent retention risk. Must demonstrate
    enterprise value and AI-Ops alignment before April 30 renewal.
