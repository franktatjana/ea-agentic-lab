    Globex Industries builds operations management software for mid-to-large
    enterprises, specializing in infrastructure orchestration and incident

    The company has been growing 25% YoY but recent leadership turnover
    and a strategic pivot toward AI-ops have created internal uncertainty.

      relationship_strength: "GROWING"
      threat_level: "HIGH"
      our_differentiation: |
        Enterprise-grade SLA, on-prem hybrid deployment, unified
        security+observability platform, compliance certifications.
      displacement_strategy: |
        Counter free-tier narrative with TCO analysis showing hidden
        costs at scale. Demonstrate enterprise features gaps.

    - competitor: "Titanmetrics + Vizara (OSS stack)"
      products_used: []
      relationship_strength: "MEDIUM"
      threat_level: "MEDIUM"
      our_differentiation: |
        Managed service eliminates operational overhead. Correlation
        across logs, metrics, traces in single platform. AI-powered alerting.
      displacement_strategy: |
        Quantify engineering hours spent on OSS maintenance.
        Position managed platform as enabling AI-Ops vision.

  competitive_risk: "HIGH"
  competitive_notes: |
    New VP Engineering from Netflix likely favors OSS stack (Titanmetrics/Vizara).
    ObservabilityVendorA free tier adoption growing bottom-up among developers.
    Must demonstrate differentiated value before renewal or risk displacement.
