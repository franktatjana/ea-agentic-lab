executive_summary: |
  Mixed signals at Globex. The AI-Ops pivot and $40M investment create a
  potential re-engagement angle, but CFO cost scrutiny and ObservabilityVendorA
  developer adoption continue to threaten renewal. New VP Engineering from
  Netflix is a wildcard: could favor open-source or value enterprise support.

    impact_assessment: |
      AI-Ops strategy requires robust telemetry, ML-ready data pipelines, and
      advanced anomaly detection. This could transform our position from
      "tool being evaluated for cut" to "strategic infrastructure for AI-Ops."
      Key question: does new VP Engineering see us as enabler or legacy?

      - role: "CSM"
        action: "Position AI-Ops readiness briefing with Emily Watson within 1 week"
      - role: "SA"
        action: "Prepare AI-Ops observability architecture proposal showing ML data pipeline value"
      - role: "AE"

    impact_assessment: |
      CFO explicitly mentioned "rationalizing vendor tools" and "proving ROI for
      every SaaS subscription over $100K." Our $180K renewal is directly in scope.
      Without a clear value story, CFO may override technical preference.
    recommended_actions:
      - role: "CSM"
        action: "Generate ROI report showing cost avoidance from incidents detected"
      - role: "AE"
        action: "Prepare CFO-ready business case; frame as AI-Ops infrastructure investment, not monitoring cost"
